At high ranks, a Fixer can move illegal goods globally, arrange big heists, or broker peace/war between gangs or corps. Mechanics: Streetdeal enables acquiring, fencing, or moving any item/service if connections exist, subject to roll and risk. Edge cases: Law/criminal heat scales with activity. Betrayals and failures risk reputation collapse or violent retribution. Special rules: Streetdeal can override scarcity for most items except ultra-rare/military/corp-only gear (subject to GM DV and connection). Fixers often have a web of owed and owing favors; tracking these (and their leverage) is key to roleplay and survival.
