Encrypted Communication Ban	All non-government/military/corp net traffic must be unencoded; password protection allowed for basic privacy	ISA (and CEP member corps)	Carrying or using encrypted data marks user as traitor/spy, subject to lethal response	[TBD]	[TBD]	[TBD]	 [oai_citation:1‡CyberGeneration-2027-VirtualFront.pdf](file-service://file-YA3D8xbvSv3tUqT2NtdZW1)	Corp data is always encoded in-house; possession of encrypted data outside official use is itself a crime
Clipper Chip Law	All legal computers must have a government-accessible Clipper chip (code-breaking backdoor); felony to operate unregistered or modified systems	Federal government	Felony charge, immediate system seizure and prosecution	Average Kitbash check to remove; illicit systems must avoid inspection	TECH (Kitbash)	Average	 [oai_citation:2‡CyberGeneration-2027-VirtualFront.pdf](file-service://file-6vxwhiR95QQNHQPLwSGwq1)	Clipper chips allow direct surveillance/decryption by state
Data Defeater Ordinance	Random line noise disrupts unauthorized net/data use in certain cities, making netrunning or illegal data transfer unreliable	Local city government, telecom	Prevents netrunning, data loss, criminal penalties for circumvention	Patchwerk utility to reconstruct data dumps; Difficult Interface or Arcane check to maintain netrun	INTERFACE or Arcane	Difficult (maintain connection)	 [oai_citation:3‡CyberGeneration-2027-VirtualFront.pdf](file-service://file-YA3D8xbvSv3tUqT2NtdZW1)	Voice transmission unaffected; repeated attempts may still trigger detection/ICE
Illegal Netrunning (Trespass)	Unauthorized access to restricted areas of Net (police, corp, etc.); equivalent of digital trespass	Netwatch, Police	Fine 50eb+, up to 5 years in Low Security Block	Hacking, use of counter-security gear/ICE breakers	INTERFACE (for hacking)	[TBD]	 [oai_citation:4‡Cyberpunk-2020-CP3171-Protect-Serve.pdf](file-service://file-5CmGXtP8WVXPiN1pAPWEhj)	Additional charges if crimes committed during run
Zeroing/Erasure	Erasure of SIN and skeleton from Net, making user a Blank (unperson)	Local government, corporate, law enforcement	No rights, cannot hold jobs, accounts, access Net officially; severe penalties if caught as a Blank	Buy from a “Shoemaker,” pass Streetdeal to secure; Falsification checks to avoid detection	Streetdeal (for service), various (for detection)	Diff. 10–30 (see table)	 [oai_citation:5‡Cyberpunk-2020-Wild-Side.pdf](file-service://file-1ZADumZvmpKYRqpWxZMBTm)	Referee rolls Reliability and Difficulty to spot fakes; permanent zeroing removes almost all legal status
Auto Defense Grid/Retinal Security	Physical and digital security tag required in restricted areas; AI/auto defenses fire immediately on unauthorized access	Corporate, Prison, Facility Security	Immediate deadly force, auto extension of sentence/instant execution	Obtain/forge security tag, AI hacking, retinal scan spoofing	TECH/INTERFACE (to bypass AI/security tag)	[TBD]	 [oai_citation:6‡Cyberpunk-2020-CP3171-Protect-Serve.pdf](file-service://file-5CmGXtP8WVXPiN1pAPWEhj)	System may allow transfer/upgrade of sentence by AI without court
Password Protection Law	Passwords permitted for civilian privacy but do not constitute legal encryption; privacy is “illusory”	Federal government	No true privacy rights; easy government decryption of all net traffic	[TBD]	[TBD]	[TBD]	 [oai_citation:7‡CyberGeneration-2027-VirtualFront.pdf](file-service://file-YA3D8xbvSv3tUqT2NtdZW1)	Legal rationale: Net declared “national resource”; court challenges are moot
Shadowdeck/Phantom Deck Protocol	Anti-trace system routes all ICE traces to a phantom (sacrificial) deck; delays or confuses active trace programs (e.g. Bloodhound)	Netwatch (countermeasure target); runners for deployment	Delays/redirects tracing ICE, reduces speed of runner deck by -2	Install shadowdeck, alter cell-deck priority; Difficult Cyberdeck Design roll	TECH (Cyberdeck Design)	Difficult	 [oai_citation:8‡Cyberpunk-2020-CP3511-Chromebook-3-4-Official.pdf](file-service://file-VNsnXWnMmLgKp34JERCrkh)	All functions on phantom deck are inaccessible to netrunner; “phantom” absorbs trace/kill routines
