Task: Create a canonical manifest table for Cyberpunk 2020 campaigns—tracking campaign title, scope, timeline, major storylines, included modules, required factions, and all cross-referenced resources (scenario/event/mission tables).

Table: `campaign_manifest.tsv`

**Schema—Columns (required):**
- Campaign Title
- Campaign Scope (one-shot, mini-series, epic, etc.)
- Start/End Date (in-world or OOC, if tracked)
- Main Location(s) (city, region, etc.)
- Major Story Arcs/Plots
- Required/Recommended Tables (cross-link to scenario, event, complication, and hook files)
- Key Factions/NPCs
- Included Modules (if any)
- Lead Ref/Author (optional)
- Status (planned, in progress, completed, archived)
- Special Notes/Warnings
- Source (if adapted or canon)

**Rules:**
- Link directly to relevant scenario/event/hook TSVs in the “Required/Recommended Tables” column.
- All rows must be system-usable, not just narrative.
- If a column is not specified for a given campaign, flag as “[TBD].”
- Output as TSV, header row first.
