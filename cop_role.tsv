Cop	Beat Cop, Detective, SWAT, Vice, Forensics, Internal Affairs, Traffic, Undercover, Tactical Captain, Commissioner	Authority	Rank 1–10; each level increases the ability to command, intimidate, or obtain compliance from civilians, suspects, and (with higher ranks) even other cops or officials. Unlocks: calling backup, getting search warrants, influencing city policy, commanding large squads at high ranks. See Special Notes for details and limitations.

Low ranks (1–3): influence civilians, get backup, basic warrants. Mid ranks (4–6): command squads, override lower ranks, access sensitive info. High ranks (7–10): influence city policy, override orders, command whole precincts. Edge cases: abuse or overuse can cause public backlash, internal affairs review, demotion, or loss of Authority; corruption or failed ops can lead to rapid reputation loss. Unique: cops are bound by codes of conduct and law—excesses (brutality, corruption) can grant short-term gain but cause severe long-term penalties.
