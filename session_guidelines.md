# Session Structure & Best Practices

## Pre-Session
- Confirm all core files loaded (Bootloader.md, core_overview.md, campaign_overview.md).
- Players finalize character stats, role files, lifepath.
- Set session tone, brief on current campaign state.

## In-Session
- All dice rolls handled via cyberpunk2020_engine.py.
- All job/event/NPC/gear generated from .tsv reference.
- Stick to session pacing: 3â€“4 major events, one complication, one surprise.
- Track all trauma, reputation, and key gear/NPC state changes.

## Post-Session
- Log session summary.
- Award IP, reputation, downtime.
- Note unresolved threads for next session.
