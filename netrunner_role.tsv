Netrunner	Console Cowboy, Cyber Wizard, Decker, Net Sentinel, Code Phantom, Virtual Merc, Netwatch Agent	Interface	Rank 1–10; each level grants increasing number of actions per net turn, improved access to system layers, control over hardware/software, and unlocks advanced netrunning maneuvers (e.g., multi-tasking, multi-system control). See Special Notes for action economy and progression limits.	Interface, System Knowledge, CyberTech, Programming, Electronics, Awareness/Notice, Stealth, INT, TECH, COOL	Cross-link to gear/deck/software tables (e.g., cyberdecks, interface plugs, deck upgrades, attack/utility/defense programs); Chromebooks for new gear	See netrunner_npc_templates.tsv if available; examples: solo decker, corporate netwatch, street ronin, virus artist	Standard 1–10 ability rank; advancement may include guild rank, rep, or net notoriety (see corebook, Virtual Front)	Netwatch, hacker collectives, corporate net ops, solo freelancers, street netrunners, cryptopunks, AI-linked groups	Access to net channels, virtual environments, restricted code, black ice, unique programs, ability to operate in Virtuality overlay and physical Net	Net trauma (paranoia, addiction, detachment), cyberpsychosis risk, digital traps, ICE attacks, personality fragmentation, rivalry with AIs or corps, burnout from extended runs	Successful hacks, ICE breakage, virus or worm deployment, theft of restricted data, missions for corps/guilds, defeating rival netrunners	Cross-link to netrunner_jobs.tsv (corporate intrusion, system heists, sabotage, AI hunting, virus installs, deep dives, paydata runs)	INT + Interface (for net actions), Interface + Program skill for running/controlling programs, COOL (resist trauma), TECH for hardware hacks	Interface is the Netrunner’s special ability: each point allows 1 net action per net turn (up to 10). Higher ranks unlock multitasking (multiple simultaneous actions), advanced programs, remote device control, and deeper/faster system penetration. Edge cases: Interface actions are limited by deck/hardware speed, program complexity, and system security. Multi-system attacks require high rank and suitable software. Special mechanics: Virtuality overlays allow interaction with reality/Net simultaneously (see CyberGeneration Virtual Front), but increase exposure to trauma and digital threats. Trauma and mental effects are tracked per netrunner_trauma_table.tsv, with mechanics for ICE effects, black ICE, data loss, and digital psychosis. Interaction with other roles (Techie for repairs, Solo for security) is common; Netrunner’s abilities are non-combat but can disable, disrupt, or kill via the Net. Full breakdown: see corebook, Virtual Front, and Chromebooks.
