Solo	Street Samurai, Bodyguard, Assassin, Mercenary, Hitman, Security Specialist, Soldier	Combat Awareness	Scales with rank (1–10); each rank grants a point to allocate among combat bonuses per round (Initiative, Accuracy, Damage, Stun Save, Death Save, and others as specified); max 10 points per round; see Special Notes for allocation and limits	REF, COOL, BODY, Handgun, Rifle, Melee, Athletics, Awareness/Notice, Dodge/Escape, Martial Arts, Brawling, Stealth	See gear/weapons tables (Blackhand’s Street Weapons, Chromebook series, Maximum Metal) and cross-link to solo_gear_table.tsv	See solo_npc_table.tsv and Solo of Fortune for sample NPCs	Military rank (grunt, officer, special forces), street rep, or mercenary standing; typically informal, but can include ex-military/corporate rank structures	Megacorporations (Arasaka, Militech), city police SWAT, mercenary companies, organized crime, nomad packs, private security firms	Access to military hardware, restricted weapons, specialized combat cyberware, contacts in black ops and mercenary networks	Combat drugs, PTSD, cyberpsychosis, notoriety, loyalty conflicts, law enforcement attention, burnout from repeated violence	Completing contracts, missions, confirmed kills, successful bodyguard assignments, survival against superior odds, rep-based achievements	Solo of Fortune and solo_jobs.tsv (bodyguard work, extraction ops, assassination, security gigs, mercenary missions, bounty hunting)	REF (combat actions), COOL (stress/fear saves), BODY (damage saves), relevant weapon/skill for attack/defense (Handgun, Rifle, Melee, etc.)	Combat Awareness is the Solo’s Special Ability; per rank, allocate points each round to Initiative (improves who acts first), Accuracy (adds to hit), Damage (adds to damage rolls), Stun Save (bonus to resist stun), Death Save (bonus to resist death). Points can be split or stacked, but cannot exceed max points per round (equal to Solo’s Special Ability rank, max 10). Must declare allocation at the start of each round. Cannot use unallocated points. May combine with cyberware and certain drugs, but bonuses are not always cumulative (see rules). Edge cases: If system ambiguity or stacking arises, default to core rules. Solo can use Combat Awareness in vehicle or hand-to-hand combat. Works with cybernetic initiative/reflex boosters, but only base stat is affected; stacking is GM’s call. Interacts with Netrunner or Techie in tactical support, but Solo’s bonuses apply only to their own actions.
