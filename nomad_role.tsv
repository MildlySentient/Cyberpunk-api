Points allow Nomad to call in favors, summon pack members, access vehicles/equipment, and gain aid or intel; limits scale by rank (low = one car/crew, high = fleets, armored convoys). The pack’s loyalty and readiness are affected by recent events and Nomad’s treatment. Edge cases: Using Family to request rare/specialized aid may require high DV or roll, with pack willingness affected by risk, reputation, and resource drain. If abused, pack support may diminish (see Neo-Tribes, corebook). Family ties are cross-referenced with pack/faction networks. Works in tandem with Fixer and Techie roles for operations, and often opposes law/corp factions.
