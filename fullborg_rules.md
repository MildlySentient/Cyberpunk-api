# Fullborg Conversion – Rules & Risks

## What is a Fullborg?
A “fullborg” is a character who undergoes total body replacement with a cybernetic chassis. Only the brain remains organic.

## Minimum Requirements
- Humanity: 20+ before conversion recommended; below 20 = instant Stage 3+ cyberpsychosis risk.
- Medical & surgical process requires medtech or clinic (see: medtech_role.md).

## Statlines
- Strength, Body, and Reflexes: set by chassis (see: fullborg_statlines.tsv)
- Armor: torso/limbs as per armor table, may exceed standard limits.
- Upgrades: Multiple slots, as per chassis.

## Risks
- Immediate Humanity cost: subtract total (often 60–80, possibly more).
- Cyberpsychosis: Most PCs drop to Stage 3 or 4 instantly unless heavily prepped.
- Social alienation: Treated as a “thing” by most; cops/corps see as asset or threat.

## Fail-safes
- Many fullborgs have inbuilt deadman switches, remote lockout, or AI override (player may lose control if asset is threatened or “goes rogue”).

## Recovery
- Stage 4 psychosis (“NPC”): no recovery possible; PC becomes referee/AI-controlled.
- Stage 3: Only possible with experimental therapy, radical brain mods, or campaign-level intervention.
