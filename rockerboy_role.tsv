Each point lets the Rockerboy influence or lead an increasing number of people (ranging from a handful at low ranks to stadium crowds at high ranks). Influence can incite, calm, or direct crowds (e.g., protest, riot, escape), subject to GM interpretation and context. Roll EMP + Charismatic Impact + relevant skill (e.g., Perform or Leadership) vs. a DV set by audience resistance or environmental factors. Effects last as long as performance or until another influence counters it. Edge cases: Charismatic Impact does not grant control over all individuals (not mind control), and is resisted by strong-willed or opposed targets; mass influence is limited by line of sight, comm access, or media reach. Interacts with Media, Fixer, and Solo roles in campaigns (e.g., inspiring an op, defusing violence, driving story events).
