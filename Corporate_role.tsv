Low ranks (1–3): minor budget, small teams, departmental resources. Mid (4–7): cross-departmental power, direct orders to security or R&D, access to classified info. High (8–10): board-level access, authorizing black ops, reshaping policy, initiating/ending corp wars. Edge cases: Resources limited by role, loyalty, and current politics; corporate infighting, audits, or rivalries can restrict use. Inter-corp actions (wars, sabotage, alliances) are managed at higher ranks, often requiring asset and personnel juggling (cross-link corp_war_timeline.tsv and corporate_relationships_matrix.tsv).
