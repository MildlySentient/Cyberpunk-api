Each rank increases influence reach and resistance to intimidation or manipulation. Rank progression unlocks deeper access: low = minor stories, local press; high = world news, major audience, near-immunity. Success/failure affects reputation and future access. Edge cases: Public influence limited by actual platform (pirate vs. network), story veracity, and audience mood; excessive bias, repeated mistakes, or caught faking leads to loss of Credibility. Interaction: Media can expose or defend other roles, work with Fixer for sources, Rockerboy for stunts, Solo for war reporting, Netrunner for data leaks.
