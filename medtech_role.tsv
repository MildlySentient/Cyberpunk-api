MedTech	Field Medic, Trauma Specialist, Biotechnician, Street Doc, Cyberdoc, Paramedic, Corpo Surgeon	Medical Tech (MedTech)	Scales 1–10; each rank improves ability to diagnose, treat, and perform surgery; unlocks advanced procedures at higher ranks (e.g., implant cyberware, perform organ transplants, rapid trauma response). Higher ranks decrease treatment/installation times and increase patient survival. See Special Notes for progression detail.

Higher ranks reduce installation/treatment time, boost survival/stabilization, and permit field improvisation. Installation times and legality: full installations require operating suite and proper gear; street/field jobs risk higher complication and legal liability. Restrictions: Certain cyberware/biotech is illegal or tightly regulated; trauma care may conflict with legal/ethical codes (e.g., working for criminals, fixing black market cyber). Subsystem: MedTech and CyberTech often interact for cyberware; edge cases include patient refusal, extreme trauma, and high-risk or exotic gear.
